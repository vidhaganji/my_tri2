    "## REFLECTION\n",
    "\n",
    "> Reflecting on my performance in the College Board MC review, I have identified several areas where I can improve.  I initially struggled with questions involving binary numbers due to a lack of confidence in my grasp of the concept. In addition, I want to adopt a more analytical approach, carefully evaluating the given information and reasoning through the problem logically. In addition, I learned about rogue access points through one of the questions. This was a new concept for me, and upon further research, I discovered how it was applicable to several of the previous questions I'd gotten correct in the exam. In conclusion, my review of the College Board MC assessment has provided valuable insights into areas for improvement. By focusing on attention to detail, conceptual understanding, critical thinking, and continuous learning, I am confident I can peform better in the future."
